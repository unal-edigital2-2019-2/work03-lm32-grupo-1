<msg type="info" file="PhysDesignRules" num="2288" delta="old" >The read port and write port clocks of BRAM instance, <arg fmt="%s" index="1">lm32_cpu/instruction_unit/icache/memories[0].way_0_tag_ram/Mram_mem</arg>, are using the same clock signal (synchronous clocking) with WRITE_FIRST mode specified. This configuration may encounter address collisions if the same address appears on both ports. It is suggested for this configuration to use READ_FIRST mode to avoid any conditions for address collision. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
